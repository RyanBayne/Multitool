Multitool is the Swiss-Army-Plugin for WordPress.
                       
== Description ==
                         
Growing websites create more administration and even more headaches. WordPress owners find themselves Googling for
the "best plugin to" do something they didn't predict and sometimes something they don't fully understand. Multitool
offers a unique approach to dealing with the one-time issues that consume time and can cause stress. 

Multitool is the multi-purpose plugin you can trust. You'll return to Multitool when you seek a small solution for a one-time
issue. You'll appreciate a simple but effecient solution. 

= Extendable =

Multitool includes an extension system. If you like the Multitool interface and my approach to a Swiss-Army-Plugin. You can
create a WordPress plugin that acts as an extension. You won't need to spend hours creating your own plugin views, submitting it
to the WordPress.org repository or manage a core project on GitHub. If your not a developer, the cost of hiring one to create
an extension will be very low.

== Version Numbers Explained ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

These are the rules followed to increase the Multitool plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
