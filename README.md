# WordPress Multitool Plugin by Ryan

The Swiss-Army-Plugin for WordPress by Ryan

There is no other plugin like Multitool. The unique approach taking in Multitool ensures that the toolbox plugin doesn't clutter your blog administration menus. There are three different tool types: Quick Tools, Configuration Tools and Advanced Tools. The plugin is expected to grow without limitations thanks to tidy user-interfaces. So when you need a new tool or feature in WordPress that normally requires another plugin after a Google search. Instead, come back to Multitool! If the plugin doesn't already have what you need I will add it.

## Main Features

## Installation
The plugin is free to download from WordPress.org and you can locate it from your WP admin by searching "Multitool". The plugin will add new items in the WP Tools menu.
